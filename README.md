Simple CLI to help users with Github Commands using <a href="https://github.com/google/zx">google/zx</a>
</p>

## :house: Getting started

This project is a helper, to guide and help begginers with tipical activities used at Liferay, to interact with Github, such as Send, List and Get a Pull Request from some fork;

The project is **under development**  and may not be fit 100% your needs. So, if you want something more robust, I'd like to suggest using [Github CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) or [Node-GH](https://github.com/node-gh/gh)

Actually, this project has some inspiration with Node-GH.
## :book: Requirement

Node.js >= `14.8.0`

## :zap: Install

```bash
npm i -g yarn # Skip if you already use it
npm i -g zx
yarn add-alias
```

When running `yarn add-alias` you need to configure which Bash are you using and then put your alias to call this project, I suggest using `gh` or any other of your preference.

Note: **Be careful to not asign an alias already in use in your computer**, such as *cd*, *git*, *mv*, *ga* etc. 

Before configure this part, verify if the alias you want aren't in use.
